Quality sleep is essential for recovery, focus, and mood.
Sleep-health recommendations:
- Keep a consistent bedtime and wake time, even on weekends.
- Limit screens and bright light for at least 30 minutes before bed.
- Avoid caffeine after noon and heavy meals right before sleep.
- Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.
- Try a relaxing routine: reading, journaling, or light stretching.
- If you can’t fall asleep, get up and do something calming, then return to bed.
Sleep is a skill — treat it like training your body for rest.
