Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to the present moment with curiosity and kindness.
Core ideas:
- Focus on your breath; notice the inhale and exhale.
- Observe thoughts as passing clouds — acknowledge them, then let them go.
- Try mindful walking: feel your feet touching the ground.
- Use short check-ins during the day to notice how you feel.
- Gratitude journaling and short meditations can strengthen mindfulness over time.
You can practice mindfulness anywhere — it’s about awareness, not perfection.
