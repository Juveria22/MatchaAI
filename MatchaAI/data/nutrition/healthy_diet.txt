Balanced nutrition supports both physical and mental well-being.
Healthy eating principles:
- Aim for colorful plates — fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins.
- Stay hydrated; drink enough water throughout the day.
- Eat mindfully — slow down and savor each bite.
- Limit added sugar and highly processed foods.
- Don’t skip meals; aim for steady energy.
- Include omega-3 rich foods (fish, chia seeds, walnuts) for brain health.
Consistency matters more than strict dieting. Build a positive relationship with food.
